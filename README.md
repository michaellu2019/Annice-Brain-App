# Annice Brain App 
I built this Android app in the summer of 2018 for a personal robotics project that might have been called Toby 🤷‍♂️. 

I used OpenCV haarcascade classifiers for image detection for human facial features and CMUPocketSphinx for speech recognition. Relative to most popular commercial microcontrollers, smartphones are pretty beefy with their computing power, so I leveraged this for the Machine Learning-reliant features, e.g. image detection and speech recognition, that would make the robot more big brain. This app also had the ability to connect to an Arduino via Bluetooth, so that it could control the movement of a robot that might have been named Toby 🤷‍♂️. Hence, the "Brain" in the name 😎.
